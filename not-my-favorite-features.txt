Things Rhymu does NOT particularly like about Rust (not saying I hate them):

1. preoccupation with integer sizes in the standard types
     i32, u64

2. opinionated naming convension for functions and variables
    Almost certainly going to use this:
        #![allow(non_snake_case)]

3. using methods from traits requires pulling in (with "use") the traits,
   and it's not immediately obvious to a casual reader why the trait is
   being pulled in.

4. excessive terseness of terms (examples: mut, Rc, str, Vec, fn)

5. String and "string slice" (&str) both use the word "string" in their names,
   which is confusing because they are different types.
