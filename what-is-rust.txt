What is Rust? (from my perspective as a long-time C++ dev)

* It's like a combination of C++ and TypeScript
- strict typing
- similar syntax to C++
- compiled and linked, not interpreted
- tools that have a JavaScript/TypeScript "flavoring"?

* Designed to be both fast and safe (as opposed to C++ which might be fast but can be dangerous as well).
