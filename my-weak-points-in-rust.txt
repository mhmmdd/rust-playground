My weak points in Rust:

* Understanding when and how to use lifetimes.
* How to properly declare and use closures.
* Avoiding multi-borrows.
* Committing to memory the meanings of all the "helper functions"
  which go along with Option, Result, Stream, etc. (e.g. "and(), ok_or_else()")
* I don't really know when to use Pin.
